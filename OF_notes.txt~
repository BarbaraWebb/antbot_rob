OPTICAL FLOW EXPERIMENTS:
- Now that everything seems to work, I will move on to experiments.

Section 1: correctness testing
ARENA 1: Basic functionality - clear pitch
- Aim: Demonstrate that the OFCA system functions in some way.
- Clear with no tussocks present in the arena
- Robot started centrally in the South end of the pitch
- The robot should navigate to the box at the North end of the pitch
- Some spurious flow reactions will be triggered despite the high walled arena.
- This is due to the distorted FOV AntBot has. This MUST be mentioned in the report.
- Also must be mentioned that this is advantageous to some degree as it seems to assist with
  wall collisions
  
A1E:
- We expect zero collisions of any sort on this run.
- For results see google sheet in drive.
- Many unexpected turns on each run.

ARENA 2: Basic functionality - Simple avoidance of a large object
- Aim: Demonstrate that the OFCA system can negotiate an obstacle
- Arena has the pickfords box present in the centre
- Robot started centrally in the South end of the pitch
- The robot should avoid the box and correct so as to avoid the wall
- The robot should make it to the box at the opposite end of the pitch however, this is
  not a requirement
  
A2E:
- We expect no full collisions or partial collisions for this test. A partial collision is
  acceptable, but it should not occur.
- Unexpected collisions and incosistent behaviour (turning on both sides)

ARENA 3: Basic functionality - Tussock interaction
- Aim: Demonstrate that the OFCA system can see and avoid the tussocks
  Note for next year, taller tussocks may be an idea.
  
- Arena set up with a line of tussocks up the East side of the pitch in the South end.
  Tussocks then set up in a similar line in the North West side.
- Robot will be started in the South West corner of the pitch

A3E:
- We expect no collisions at all.
- Robot performed exceptionally well taking slightly varying paths

Basic functionality:
- No issues should be experienced here

For all following experiments, we divide the pitch into quadrants: NE, NW, SE, SW.

We now look at scaling complexity. Randomly distributed tussocks with enough space
for the robot to pass through, N per quadrant.
13 tussocks, so we can go for 1, 2, 3 per quadrant. Does not sound a lot but is quite dense.
General trend; we expect to see collision rise as we increase N. Robot shall always
be started from the south west corner. The start point was chosen so that the robot
has to do something; it cannot simply go straight to its goal.

One per quad:
- No issues but robot ran out of time on the first run.
- Stopped slightly short on second.
- Third was fine
- Robot didn't seem to follow the same route twice.

Two per quad:
- Robot still stopping slightly short at times
- Two consecutive runs connected with the same tussock but a reaction was triggered.

Three per quad:
- Robot made incorrect first turn and turned towards the wall of the arena. It is known
  that once it makes its way in here, the run is unrecoverable. This is successful as the robot
  avoided the tussocks, but unsucessful in that the robot cornered itself.

  A development for this system would be to include a desired direction in the decision to turn.
  I.e. weight the turns with the desired direction. As of now the robot has no such weighting.
  So the turn will be triggered purely on raw flow with no planning or forethought

- Final run of this arena showed that the window size could still be affecting the

More experiments could be run; I don't feel like this is very thourough, but I will ask.
May be worth predicting the robot's behaviour and setting up specialist arenas. For example
fully blocked or guided into a corner. The note about heading is a good take away.
