This repository contains all information relevant to my (s1432329) honours project. A copy of my dissertation can be found /Dissertation/pdf/diss.pdf
along with the LaTeX and BibTex source files and compile scripts. Code which has been added is a little spread out, but it should all be within
the AntEye Android application. I reccommend opening these files using Android Studio as attempting to navigate them using a text editor and terminal
is difficult.
