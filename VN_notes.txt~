Notes for visual navigation experimentation:

Part 1: VICON
- I can use vicon to record runs and the timer on the threads easily gives me enough time to
  run recordings for outward, then outward memory.

- Would like to run a single recording then get the data from it to see how it is formatted
- The data is in a .csv so pandas may be useful; want to see what plots I can produce

notes:
- Vicon files need modified slightly before they can be plotted. However, this is easy to do, and
  once done, they can be parsed and plotted with ease.

how-to:
- Record runs on vicon
- Export runs to csv in the Desktop\antbot_tracks folder on the vicon machine
- Upload the csvs to Drive
- Download on laptop
- Remove lines 1, 2, 3, and 5
- Run vicon.py to get a trajectory plot of the two routes.
- Do with this whatever needs done

Part 2: Experiments; design and implementation
- Want different arenas. Arenas which are easy for the OF to navigate as this is not what
  we're testing.

- Want to make sure the robot has to make some navigational decisions.

- Homeward routes? How hard would this be to implement as a curiosity?

  - During learning learn the outward image, learn the homeward image at the same time by doing
    a rotateMatInAzimuth variant which returns a matrix. If possible, it may be nice to get an image
    from the cameras to show the route taken.
