OPTICAL FLOW EXPERIMENTS:
- Now that everything seems to work, I will move on to experiments.

Section 1: correctness testing
ARENA 1: Basic functionality - clear pitch
- Aim: Demonstrate that the OFCA system functions in some way.
- Clear with no tussocks present in the arena
- Robot started centrally in the South end of the pitch
- The robot should navigate to the box at the North end of the pitch
- Some spurious flow reactions will be triggered despite the high walled arena.
- This is due to the distorted FOV AntBot has. This MUST be mentioned in the report.
- Also must be mentioned that this is advantageous to some degree as it seems to assist with
  wall collisions
  
A1E:
- We expect zero collisions of any sort on this run.
- For results see google sheet in drive.
- Many unexpected turns on each run.

ARENA 2: Basic functionality - Simple avoidance of a large object
- Aim: Demonstrate that the OFCA system can negotiate an obstacle
- Arena has the pickfords box present in the centre
- Robot started centrally in the South end of the pitch
- The robot should avoid the box and correct so as to avoid the wall
- The robot should make it to the box at the opposite end of the pitch however, this is
  not a requirement
  
A2E:
- We expect no full collisions or partial collisions for this test. A partial collision is
  acceptable, but it should not occur.
- Unexpected collisions and incosistent behaviour (turning on both sides)

ARENA 3: Basic functionality - Tussock interaction
- Aim: Demonstrate that the OFCA system can see and avoid the tussocks
  Note for next year, taller tussocks may be an idea.
  
- Arena set up with a line of tussocks up the East side of the pitch in the South end.
  Tussocks then set up in a similar line in the North West side.
- Robot will be started in the South West corner of the pitch

A3E:
- We expect no collisions at all.
- Robot performed exceptionally well taking slightly varying paths

Basic functionality:
- No issues should be experienced here

For all following experiments, we divide the pitch into quadrants: NE, NW, SE, SW.

We now look at scaling complexity. Randomly distributed tussocks with enough space
for the robot to pass through, N per quadrant.
13 tussocks, so we can go for 1, 2, 3 per quadrant. Does not sound a lot but is quite dense.
General trend; we expect to see collision rise as we increase N. Robot shall always
be started from the south west corner. The start point was chosen so that the robot
has to do something; it cannot simply go straight to its goal.

One per quad:
- No issues but robot ran out of time on the first run.
- Stopped slightly short on second.
- Third was fine
- Robot didn't seem to follow the same route twice.

Two per quad:
- Robot still stopping slightly short at times
- Two consecutive runs connected with the same tussock but a reaction was triggered.

Three per quad:
- Robot made incorrect first turn and turned towards the wall of the arena. It is known
  that once it makes its way in here, the run is unrecoverable. This is successful as the robot
  avoided the tussocks, but unsucessful in that the robot cornered itself.

  A development for this system would be to include a desired direction in the decision to turn.
  I.e. weight the turns with the desired direction. As of now the robot has no such weighting.
  So the turn will be triggered purely on raw flow with no planning or forethought

- Final run of this arena showed that the window size could still be affecting the

More experiments could be run; I don't feel like this is very thorough, but I will ask.
May be worth predicting the robot's behaviour and setting up specialist arenas. For example
fully blocked or guided into a corner. The note about heading is a good take away.

Special tests:
- effect of speed
- effect of window size
- predictable behaviour in certain arenas

- thresholds have been tuned specifically; modifying these increases or decreases sensitivity of
  the system. This will be discussed as a development thing rather than an experimentation thing.

- for these, keep track of any collisions and behaviour across multiple experiments
- does the robot behave as expected? does it behave this way consistently? if not is there
  an immediately obvious reason as to why? collisions etc.

Effect of speed: 2nd
- cluster of tussocks designed to induce a certain turn
- run the robot toward the tussock at a certain speed
- see how the flow response changes with speed (make sure to account for power differences!)
- Reaction time did not change with speed, but stability did. Stability seemed to improve as
  speed was increased; noise did not have as strong an effect on robot responses, straight lines
  more common. I do not think these experiments were worth anything. They should be discussed,
  however, they should not be discussed as results; more as an experimental error; the times
  should not be identical like that.

Effect of window size: 3rdp
- window size has been tuned; smaller will struggle
- increase window size and note behavioural changes
- tussocks to the side, tussocks to the front should react to the front.


Predictable arenas: 1st
- diagonal line of tussocks, robot started from South; painted into a corner
  - Expected behaviour: Robot follows the line of tussocks into the corner; consistently
    tussocks are of higher priority than the wall
- try to guide the robot around the arena "ring" of tussocks; robot started from South West
- diagonal guides on either side. will the robot go through? robot started from the South
- Almost all of these experiments failed: I can reason that this is due to the crude nature
  of the response.
  
  - Diagonal line -> robot given too much run in time, reacted to noise on the right (shouldn't
    be an issue?); placing the robot closer to the line made it work as expected.

  - Ring -> Robot initially behaved as desired, but turned away from the line too quickly. As
    a result it reacted to the wall over the line and turned back into the line. In one case
    the robot took a tight turn away from the line and there was no collision. The other four
    experiments saw the robot take the exact same route with the same flaws. Example of where
    something like klinokinesis may be a good idea for the flow response (next year)

  - Flute -> Robot reacted to one side, and then couldn't regain its route instead ploughing into
    one side of the flute. The robot performed the same movements consistently even if it moved in
    different directions. Widening the flute significantly almost resulted in success, but the
    robot couldn't react quickly enough. Instead of triggering a saccade, if possible, it'd be
    nice to implement some kind of feedback control on speeds based on flow difference. Quicker
    and smoother responses.
