Section 1 - Introduction:

	{NOTE: need to briefly define Path Integration somewhere 

	Path Integration is the ability of the ant to determine its
	displacement from the nest using odometric and directional
	information, the ant uses the integrated path to learn the a straight
	route from the nest to a food source.}
	

	Cataglyphis Velox, herein referred to as ants, or desert ants have the
	amazing ability to navigate through complex natural environments using
	only low-resolution visual information and minimal computational
	complexity. The "Ant Navigational Toolkit", proposed in 2009 by
	Wehner describes the two most prominant components in ant navigation:
	Path Integration, and Visual Navigation. In this paper, we focus on
	the latter alongside a biologically plausible method for performing
	collision avoidance. A robot, based on a mobile phone, has been
	constructed as a development platform in order to implement the
	algorithms in the Ant Navigational Toolkit.

	Section 1.1 - Motivation:
	
	Insects are remarkably good at using visual cues to perform navigation.
	A model for visual memory and learning has been proposed by Ardin et
	al. which shows that the Mushroom Body neuropils (traditionally
	considered a mechanism for purely olfactory learning) provides a
	plausible neural circuit for encoding visual memories.

	The Mushroom Body circuit has been implemented and tested on AntBot prior.
	However, the existing model is quite simple, using binary weightings for
	the neural connections, and a single boolean Extrinsic Neuron denoting
	whether, or not, an image was recognised. A method was implemented by
	Zhang in 2017 using eight ENs each of which denoted one of the eight
	cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). This will be discussed in
	section <<SECTION>>.

	We also look at biologically inspired methods of Collision Avoidance (CA)
	using optical flow techniques.

	============================================================================

	Section 1.2 - Project Goals:
	
	This paper shall discuss methods of improving upon the existing Mushroom
	Body model, as well as experiment with different methods of biologically
	inspired Collision Avoidance. The final goal being, to send the robot on
	a journey through an obstacle course and then see if it could reproduce the
	same route using visual memories.

	The first stage of the project focuses on the Collision Avoidance, as a
	pre-requisite to collecting our route information. The traditional methods
	of performing CA in robots tend to use SONAR or LIDAR sensors, however, ants
	do not posess these sensory capabilities so far as we know.
	It has been shown that Optical Flow (OF) provides a biologically feasible way
	of performing CA [Drosophila], and even	some navigational tasks [Honeybees].

	A few OF techniques are available which allow us to perform CA, and so, we will
	look at a selection. We will look at using the effects of using different types
	of flow field, and then different the different methods of detecting obstacles.
	In the context of this project this is assumed to be low level, reactionary
	behaviour (i.e. we do not use a neural model or perform any processing, rather
	we react based on immediate stimulus). 

	We will then begin to experiment with the Mushroom Body network, first
	establishing a measure of baseline performance by using the original "basic"
	network. The robustness of the network will be tested similarly to [Ardin],
	wherein the robot may deviate from the memorised route by so much that it can
	never find the path again. These instances of the robot getting "lost" will be
	counted as errors. After establishing a baseline for performance, we will
	compare and contrast different versions of the MB circuit to see if we
	can improve upon the performance presented by our predecessors while still
	remaining biologically feasible.

	Finally, we will report the results of the tests performed during the
	different stages of development, as well as comparing results with relevant
	results from previous iterations of this project. We will end with a conclusion
	noting contributions to the project, as well as discussing limitations and
	possible future developments.
