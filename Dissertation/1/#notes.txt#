1. Introduction:
- Mention extending the Mushroom Body network but this was never fully realised.

1.1 Motivation:
- Italiscise Eberding and Zhang

1.2 Goals:
- Mentioning the Homeward task as a goal; I can and would like to keep this in
  but it could be tweaked to be more of a curiosity than an outright goal.

  to make it more accurate
