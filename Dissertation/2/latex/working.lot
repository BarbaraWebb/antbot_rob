\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The available commands on the Arduino and the messages sent to invoke them. Those values which are changeable are shown in italics. The \textit {go} command was added by \textit {Scimeca}. This table was adapted from \cite {Eberding2016, Scimeca2017}. \relax }}{15}
\contentsline {table}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces The results for the functional performance experiments on the filtering CA system. (*) This was the only case of a risk on end coming from a tussock during formal experiments, all other potential collisions were with the side of the arena. (**) The first turn the robot made took it away from the arena in the manner described in 5\hbox {}, the collision was with the arena wall in the South East corner as the robot had no where left to go. \relax }}{34}
\contentsline {table}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces The results for the behavioural experiments conducted on the optical flow system; for these, arenas were designed to elicit a certain behavioural response, however, they mostly failed to do so, highlighting problems with the current implementation and methods of experimentation. The ``As expected'' column denotes cases whether the robot performed the expected moves: No means not at all, Almost means that movements were initially correct then went wrong, and Yes means complete success. \relax }}{36}
\contentsline {table}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces The summarised results for the VN experiments. All distances are given in millimetres. The green and red distances correspond to the distances marked in green dashes and red dashes on the plots. Distance taken denotes the distance used to determine success; N/A was given in the case where neither measure was more meaningful than the other. For an explanation of interpretation, please see the results discussion for VN experiments. (*) While we consider this run a success, the memory route does deviate significantly from the learned route though it seems correction is attempted. (**) These are considered edge cases, by our interpretation they are successes, however they could also be considered failures (particularly MAB-4-1). This table was copied by hand; in the case the distances presented disagree with the distances on the plots, the plots prevail. We count a $77\%$ success rate including edge cases, $66\%$ excluding. \relax }}{40}
