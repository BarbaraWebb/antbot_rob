\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The Mushroom Body circuit: (Caption from \textit {Ardin et al.}, Figure 2; note, their description and figure uses ``EN'' instead of ``MBON''): Images (see Fig 1) activate the visual projection neurons (vPNs). Each Kenyon cell (KC) receives input from 10 (random) vPNs and exceeds firing threshold only for coincident activation from several vPNs, thus images are encoded as a sparse pattern of KC activation. All KCs converge on a single extrinsic neuron (EN) and if activation coincides with a reward signal, the connection strength is decreased. After training the EN output to previously rewarded (familiar) images is few or no spikes.\relax }}{7}

(Left) This graph demonstrates the basic structure of the CX model (Figure 5G from \cite {Stone2017}). Pontine neurons have been excluded for clarity. (Right) This graph shows how signals propogate through the network where the current heading lies to the left of the desired heading, i.e. a right turn should be generated (Figure 5I from \cite {Stone2017}). The numbers given at each layer on the right correspond to the numbers given for each neuron in the graph on the left. \relax }}{11}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces Here we can see the layers of the CX model and how they fit together. A heading signal is input to the TL neurons, propogating through the CL layer to TB1 (heading ring-attractor) and CPU4 (memory). TN neurons (speed sensitivity) input directly to CPU4. So, the combination of heading and speed inputs to CPU4 gives a measure of distance travelled in a particular direction; this facilitates generation of a steering command in CPU1 providing a mechanism for path integration. \relax }}{12}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces Our interpretation of the eight MBON model proposed by \textit {Zhang}. Every KC connects to every MBON. All connection weights start out at $w=1$. Following the example presented in the text, if an image being learned corresponds to facing a direction of $45^{\circ }$, then only the conncetions to that MBON (highlighted in red) are eligible to have their weights modified. Recall, however, that these weights will only be modified if the KC was activated (not shown in the figure). \relax }}{17}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {14}{\ignorespaces An example of signal propogation and generated output from the rate-based system (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). An example flow input is given as 0.25. The ACC rate response is then put through the offset computation function (Eq. 22\hbox {}). The default sinusoid function is generated over eight array elements. The function is then shifted such that the maximum lies at \textit {current\textunderscore direction + round(offset)} which in this case is 5. This sinusoid is then extended to a sixteen elements to match the representation in CPU4. Each element of the sinusoid is then supplied as input to the corresponding MRSP neuron to give the rate output in the final plot. This MRSP response is used as input to the CPU1 layer, in this example a small right turn will be generated. \relax }}{31}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {16}{\ignorespaces A test recording from the Central Complex PI experiments. The agent successfully navigates home but requires a large turning arc to point back towards the nest. This is because the output of the CX is not a precise angle but instead a turn direction with some strength. This behaviour was our prompt and justification to include an about turn on completion of the outbound route; the space present in the arena simply did not permit such routes for formal experiments. \relax }}{34}

Note that the agent was not started directly on the tape square, it was offset as shown by the path; this was oversight on our part. \relax }}{36}
