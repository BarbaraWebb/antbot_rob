\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Our interpretation of the eight MBON model proposed by \textit {Zhang}. Every KC connects to every MBON. All connection weights start out at $w=1$. Following the example presented in the text, if an image being learned corresponds to facing a direction of $45^{\circ }$, then only the conncetions to that MBON (highlighted in red) are elligable to have their weights modified. Recall, however, that these weights will only be modified if the KC was activated (not shown in the figure). \relax }}{8}
