{\LARGE \textbf{Acknowledgements}}
\begin{flushleft}
 {\small
  I would like to take the opportunity to thank my supervisor, Dr. Barbara Webb, for her
  guidance, and invaluable insight on the subject matter. My gratitude also extends to
  Zhaoyu Zhang and Leonard Eberding, two of my predecessors on this project; both have been
  extremely useful in explaining the existing codebase and operations of the robot where they
  were not always clear. Finally I should like to thank my parents, for their unwavering support
  throughout my education; I could not have made it here without them. }
