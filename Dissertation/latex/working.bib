    abstract = { In this paper we try to develop an algorithm for visual obstacle avoidance of autonomous mobile robot. The input of the algorithm is an image sequence grabbed by an embedded camera on the B21r robot in motion. Then, the optical flow information is extracted from the image sequence in order to be used in the navigation algorithm. The optical flow provides very important information about the robot environment, like: the obstacles disposition, the robot heading, the time to collision and the depth. The strategy consists in balancing the amount of left and right side flow to avoid obstacles, this technique allows robot navigation without any collision with obstacles. The robustness of the algorithm will be showed by some examples. }

    abstract = {Author Summary The interest in insect navigation from diverse disciplines such as psychology and engineering is to a large extent because performance is achieved with such limited brain power. Desert ants are particularly impressive navigators, able to rapidly learn long, visually guided foraging routes. Their elegant behaviours provide inspiration to biomimetic engineers and for psychologists demonstrate the minimal mechanistic requirements for complex spatial behaviours. In this spirit, we have developed a parsimonious model of route navigation that captures many of the known properties of ants routes. Our model uses a neural network trained with the visual scenes experienced along a route to assess the familiarity of any view. Subsequent route navigation involves a simple behavioural routine, in which the simulated ant scans the world and moves in the most familiar direction, as determined by the network. The algorithm exhibits both place-search and route navigation using the same mechanism. Crucially, in our model it is not necessary to specify when or what to learn, nor separate routes into sequences of waypoints; thereby providing proof of concept that route navigation can be achieved without these elements. As such, we believe it represents the only detailed and complete model of insect route guidance to date.},

abstract="Desert ants are expert navigators, foraging over large distances using visually guided routes. Recent models of route following can reproduce aspects of route guidance, yet the underlying motor patterns do not reflect those of foraging ants. Specifically, these models select the direction of movement by rotating to find the most familiar view. Yet scanning patterns are only occasionally observed in ants. We propose a novel route following strategy inspired by klinokinesis. By using familiarity of the view to modulate the magnitude of alternating left and right turns, and the size of forward steps, this strategy is able to continually correct the heading of a simulated ant to maintain its course along a route. Route following by klinokinesis and visual compass are evaluated against real ant routes in a simulation study and on a mobile robot in the real ant habitat. We report that in unfamiliar surroundings the proposed method can also generate ant-like scanning behaviours.",

	abstract = {Visual landmarks guide humans and animals including insects to a goal location. Insects, with their miniature brains, have evolved a simple strategy to find their nests or profitable food sources; they approach a goal by finding a close match between the current view and a memorised retinotopic representation of the landmark constellation around the goal. Recent implementations of such a matching scheme use raw panoramic images ({\textquoteleft}image matching{\textquoteright}) and show that it is well suited to work on robots and even in natural environments. However, this matching scheme works only if relevant landmarks can be detected by their contrast and texture. Therefore, we tested how honeybees perform in localising a goal if the landmarks can hardly be distinguished from the background by such cues. We recorded the honeybees{\textquoteright} flight behaviour with high-speed cameras and compared the search behaviour with computer simulations. We show that honeybees are able to use landmarks that have the same contrast and texture as the background and suggest that the bees use relative motion cues between the landmark and the background. These cues are generated on the eyes when the bee moves in a characteristic way in the vicinity of the landmarks. This extraordinary navigation performance can be explained by a matching scheme that includes snapshots based on optic flow amplitudes ({\textquoteleft}optic flow matching{\textquoteright}). This new matching scheme provides a robust strategy for navigation, as it depends primarily on the depth structure of the environment.},

	abstract = {Flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) locate a concealed appetitive odour source most accurately in environments containing vertical visual contrasts. To investigate how visuomotor and olfactory responses may be integrated, we examine the free-flight behaviour of flies in three visual conditions, with and without food odour present. While odour localisation is facilitated by uniformly distributed vertical contrast as compared with purely horizontal contrast, localised vertical contrast also facilitates odour localisation, but only if the odour source is situated close to it. We implement a model of visuomotor control consisting of three parallel subsystems: an optomotor response stabilising the model fly{\textquoteright}s yaw orientation; a collision avoidance system to saccade away from looming obstacles; and a speed regulation system. This model reproduces many of the behaviours we observe in flies, including visually mediated {\textquoteleft}rebound{\textquoteright} turns following saccades. Using recordings of real odour plumes, we simulate the presence of an odorant in the arena, and investigate ways in which the olfactory input could modulate visuomotor control. We reproduce the experimental results by using the change in odour intensity to regulate the sensitivity of collision avoidance, resulting in visually mediated chemokinesis. Additionally, it is necessary to amplify the optomotor response whenever odour is present, increasing the model fly{\textquoteright}s tendency to steer towards features of the visual environment. We conclude that visual and olfactory responses of Drosophila are not independent, but that relatively simple interaction between these modalities can account for the observed visual dependence of odour source localisation.

	abstract = {The mushroom bodies of the bee are paired neuropils in the dorsal part of the brain. Each is composed of the arborizations of over 17 x 104 small interneurons of similar architecture called Kenyon cells. Golgi staining demonstrates that these neurons can be divided into five groups distinguished on the basis of their dendritic specializations and geometry. The mushroom body neuropils each consist of a pair of cup-shaped structures, the calyces, connected by two short fused stalks, the pedunculus, to two lobes, the Î±- and Î²-lobes. Each calyx is formed from three concentric neuropil zones, the basal ring, the collar and the lip. The calyces are organized in a polar fashion; within the calyces each of the five categories of Kenyon cell has a distribution limited to particular polar contours. The dendritic volumes of neighbouring Kenyon cells arborizing within each individual contour are greatly overlapped. Fibres from groups of neighbouring cells within a calycal contour are gathered into bundles that project into the pedunculus, each fibre dividing to enter both the the Î±- and Î²-lobes. The pedunculus and the lobes are conspicuously layered. Kenyon cells with neighbouring dendritic fields within the same calycal contour occupy a single layer in the pedunculus and lobes. Thus the two- polar organization of the calyces is transformed into a Cartesian map within the pedunculus, which continues into the Î±- and Î²-lobes. The calyx receives input fibres from both the antennal lobes and the optic neuropils. The branching patterns of these cells reflect the polar organization of the calyces as their terminals are restricted to one or more of the three gross compartments of the calycal neuropil. The course of these tracts and the morphologies of the fibres that they contain are described. Cells considered to represent outputs from the mushroom bodies arborize in the pedunculus and Î±- and Î²-lobes. Generally the arborizations of the output neurons reflect the layered organization of these neuropils. Fibres from the two lobes run to the anterior median and lateral protocerebral neuropil, and the anterior optic tubercle. Additionally there is an extensive network of feedback interneurons that inter- connect the Î±- and Î²-lobes with the ipsi- and contralateral calyces. Many individual neurons have branches in both the Î±- and Î²-lobes and in the pedunculus. The pathways and geometries of the fibres subserving the two lobes are described. The hypothesis of Vowles (1955) that the individual lobes represent a separation of sensory and motor output areas is shown to be incorrect. The anatomy of the bee{\textquoteright}s mushroom bodies suggests that they process second-order antennal and fourth- and higher-order visual information. The feedback pathways are discussed as possible means of creating long-lasting after-effects which may be important in complex timing processes and possibly the formation of short-term memory.},
