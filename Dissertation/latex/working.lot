\contentsline {table}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces The results for the functional performance experiments on the filtering CA system. (*) This was the only case of a risk on end coming from a tussock during formal experiments, all other potential collisions were with the side of the arena. (**) The first turn the robot made took it away from the arena in the manner described in 5\hbox {}, the collision was with the arena wall in the South East corner as the robot had no where left to go. \relax }}{32}
\contentsline {table}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces The results for the behavioural experiments conducted on the optical flow system; for these, arenas were designed to elicit a certain behavioural response, however, they mostly failed to do so, highlighting problems with the current implementation and methods of experimentation. The ``As expected'' column denotes cases whether the robot performed the expected moves: No means not at all, Almost means that movements were initially correct then went wrong, and Yes means complete success. \relax }}{34}
