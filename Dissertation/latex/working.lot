(*) This was the only case of a risk on end coming from a tussock during formal experiments, all other potential collisions were with the side of the arena (this scenario will be discussed further in Section 7\hbox {}). (**) The first turn the robot made took it away from the arena in the manner described in 5\hbox {}, the collision was with the arena wall in the South East corner as the robot had no where left to go. \relax }}{32}
