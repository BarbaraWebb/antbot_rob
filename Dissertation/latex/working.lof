Each covers \nobreakspace {}105 deg. of azimuth but they are centred at $\pm 3$ deg. (elevation = 0 deg.). (B) Control diagram for collision avoidance. Only the half of the system that triggers rightward saccades is shown for clarity; the other half has an identical configuration. The dark blue box represents the blue wide-field filter in A. The reset operation also applies to the other half of the system, i.e. a saccade in one direction sets both accumulators to 0. Thresh., threshold; ang. vel., angular velocity. \relax }}{8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces The Mushroom Body circuit: (Caption from \textit {Ardin et al.} Figure 2): Images (see Fig 1) activate the visual projection neurons (vPNs). Each Kenyon cell (KC) receives input from 10 (random) vPNs and exceeds firing threshold only for coincident activation from several vPNs, thus images are encoded as a sparse pattern of KC activation. All KCs converge on a single extrinsic neuron (EN) and if activation coincides with a reward signal, the connection strength is decreased. After training the EN output to previously rewarded (familiar) images is few or no spikes. \relax }}{9}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces The erroneous familiarity pattern displayed by the network. The plot shows the familiarity response of the Extrinsic Neuron (y-axis) against the index of the scan (x-axis). 0 denotes the leftmost direction, 15 directly ahead, and 30 the rightmost direction. This was a simple plot produced early in the debugging process, hence the lack of axis labelling and higher number of scan points. \relax }}{22}
