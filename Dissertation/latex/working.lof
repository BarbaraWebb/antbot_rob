\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces The Mushroom Body circuit: (Caption from \textit {Ardin et al.} Figure 2): Images (see Fig 1) activate the visual projection neurons (vPNs). Each Kenyon cell (KC) receives input from 10 (random) vPNs and exceeds firing threshold only for coincident activation from several vPNs, thus images are encoded as a sparse pattern of KC activation. All KCs converge on a single extrinsic neuron (EN) and if activation coincides with a reward signal, the connection strength is decreased. After training the EN output to previously rewarded (familiar) images is few or no spikes. \relax }}{9}

When moving forward, for example, we expect the rectangular 360 [degree] image to have vector flows in different length throughout the frame, in the pattern shown in the Figure. \newline Figure (b) shows the filter response of the modified filtering process for this [\textit {Scimeca's}] project. During matching, the found flow vectors will be projected onto the corresponding filter vectors nullifying the information on the y axis and scaling the vectors differently depending on the area of the image they are found in. \relax }}{21}
