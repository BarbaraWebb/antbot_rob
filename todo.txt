Todo file for 2018:
15 / 10 / 18:
Todo:
- Establish a way of retrieving encoder information from the arduino
- Check the robot actually works after all the software stuf.

11 / 10 / 18:
Notes:
- May need to move CX representation into its own class. Network updates
  could be done using functions.
10 / 10 / 18:
Notes:
- Project has been upticked. Android Studio on the laptop should be updated
  to reflect this.

- Gradle scripts have been modified to facilitate this. There is a concern for
  potential deprecation of existing code. 

- Now code formatting must start. 80 char limit on lines up to 100 char hard 
  limit. This to make it easier to read and work on in portrait mode and 
  generally improve readability.

09 / 10 / 18:
Todo:
- Read CX model stuff from Stone et al.
- Write an execution thread which will do the following:
  Outward run using OFCA, inbound using CXPI, outbound using CXPI, inbound using
  MB, outbound using MB STOP. All of these will use visual scanning.

==
- Re-write Mega code to use the new sensor.
- Re-write Mega code for Polulu shield.
- Invesitgate rotary encoders for Polulu shield.
- Fetch .emacs

Notes:
- Found an error from last year; I was still using the getAvgMinIndex function
  which seems to be returning the correct information, but still, this may
  explain the odd instances of erratic behaviour.

- Can the Runnables be moved to their own files? They're causing the biggest
  problem with file size

- This software has been badly hacked.

- All FOE/TTC flow computation related code has been removed completely. It
  may still be referenced in the Old file, or in commit history.

- Refactor done for now. Most of the big stuff is out the way, some smaller
  refactors could be done but the code is at least workable now.
  
Done:
- (Discarded) Switch to Gnome 3  
- (Done) Re-factor the existing code; remove the 3000 line file. Find a way to
  fix it. Actually 4500 lines :)
      - Move utility functions to their own class (rotate image, get min etc.)
      - Move command functions to their own class (go, move, turn, etc.)
      - Dead code removal. All unused variables/threads/functions
      
Story so far:
Upgraded the robot with a new sensor. Research took place to find the
most suitable sensor. Arduino code has now been included in the repo
so as to make it easier to work with and integrate it into VC. Research
has taken place into using the polulu zumo shield as an alternative to
the Rover 5 based AntBot.
