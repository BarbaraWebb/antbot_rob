todo:
 - Optical flow detection implementation
   > onCvCameraFrame is the main callback method used (everything happens
     in response to a new visual stimulus
   > From here the threads are run
   > Looking at repurposing existing method computeSparseOpicFlow()
     originally used for speed calculation. Not used anywhere else, so
     may be modified.
 
notes:
 - Optical flow paper: http://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2005/papers/low.pdf ::CITE::
   > Detect corners using sparse flow and goodFeaturesToTrack
   > Compute range over a series of frames
   > Halt if below some threshold
   > Tune manually

 - Cross correlation matching?

 - Turns out the optical flow as described by Luca isn't actually there
   > Actually I was wrong, it is, but it's not in the flow computation method; it's in the getSpeeds method
 - Seems to be a number of implementations of image rotation/reshaping/remapping


 - Line 2117: if ( Maths.abs( mod((int) currentPointsTotrack.get(i,j)[0] + 12, 90) - mod((int) prevPointsToTrack.get(i,j)[0] + 12, 90)) < 70 ) {...}
   Taking a distance between two x coordinates of points + 12, this is the pixel offset for the left hand side.
   Looks like, if the distance difference between points in the image (mod 90 for image overlap), is greater than 70, then we have enough information to compute
   a flow vector (IMPORTANT FOR OBSTACLES)

 - So, where to implement my stuff?..
   >Can add functions in MainActivity.java - Function for detection? Then work the behaviour into the appropriate threads (i.e. if clear move step else halt)

progress:
- Actually know how the existing stuff works. The method described by Luca IS present despite what I initially thought; he computes the flow vectors manually
- Added menu options and appropriate back-end code
- Have an idea as to how to implement behaviour:
  A low level (instinct level) function running on each frame to check distances using the methods described in the paper linked above

- Getting this optical flow off the ground
  >Compute the focus of expansion

- May need to restructure existing OF flow code so sparse code may be used without
  messing with dense code
