This directory contains raw data files for experiments (.csv). These should be
exactly what was produced by VICON (no modifications to the files herein!).

If you want to modify them, copy them elsewhere.

cx_csv: Contains the initial CX tests. These are simply demonstrations of the
				existing CX network with a "random" outbound path. These were recorded
				and exported with multiple tracked objects selected and so may require
				more processing than other csv files. Also contains the demo recording
				as a justification for the 180 degree turn.
