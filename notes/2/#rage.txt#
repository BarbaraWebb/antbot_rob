This file contains a list of problems I'm finding with the AntBot:
1. Battery life (Nexus):
2. Reset procedure:
3. Flimsy construction (camera attachment):
4. Inability to upgrade (sensor problem; speak to Garry first):
5. Android:
   - Getting files off the thing is a pain
	 - AntEye can suddenly vanish from the list of running applications
	 - Even when shutting AntEye down and resetting, motor commands still
	 	 seem to be in the pipeline.
	 - Even if motors have stopped, sometimes selecting a menu option will
	   cause the robot to send commands as if it were still performing the task
	xo	 that was being performed
xo	 - UI Output requires variables to be global to the activity for some reason.
	   This could be to do with the way the output is done in the current software.
		 Anyway, Android constraints are forcing bad software practices.

   - Matrix multiplication is a pain on Android (OpenCV for Java/Android): Matrix
	   ops in general tbh. Python would be easier (hint hint, Python)
	 - Limited options for including hardware (IR or OF sensors could have been
	 	 extremely useful
	 - Library limitation OpenCV vs JavaCV ByteDeco

6. Multi-layer construction:
	 - Impossible to use feedback to control motion in an immediate way
	 - Can make operation clunky to the point it does not allow certain
	   things to work (CX isHome does not work because odometry is painfully
		 inaccurate)
	 - Encoders are pretty much inaccessible (note; they're not but nothing is
	   documented so it's difficult to figure out how to implement such a
		 communication).

7. (Apparently) Incorrect code
