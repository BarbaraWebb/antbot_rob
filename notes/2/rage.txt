This file contains a list of problems I'm finding with the AntBot:
1. Battery life (Nexus):
2. Reset procedure:
3. Flimsy construction (camera attachment):
4. Inability to upgrade (sensor problem; speak to Garry first):
5. Android:
   - Getting files off the thing is a pain
	 - AntEye can suddenly vanish from the list of running applications
	 - Even when shutting AntEye down and resetting, motor commands still
	 	 seem to be in the pipeline.
	 - Even if motors have stopped, sometimes selecting a menu option will
	   cause the robot to send commands as if it were still performing the task
		 that was being performed
