This file contains a list of problems I'm finding with the AntBot:
1. Battery life (Nexus): Bad as screen must always be on; and the
   phone is often connected to the PC as a power source; this kills the
	 battery
2. Reset procedure: Often doesn't work and a full reset is required
3. Flimsy construction (camera attachment): Moves around
4. Inability to upgrade (sensor problem; speak to Garry first): Yeah, likely
	 less of an issue than first thought.
5. Android:
   - Getting files off the thing is a pain
	 - AntEye can suddenly vanish from the list of running applications
	 - Even when shutting AntEye down and resetting, motor commands still
	 	 seem to be in the pipeline.
	 - Even if motors have stopped, sometimes selecting a menu option will
	   cause the robot to send commands as if it were still performing the task
		 that was being performed
	 - UI Output requires variables to be global to the activity for some reason.
	   This could be to do with the way the output is done in the current software.
		 Anyway, Android constraints are forcing bad software practices.

   - Matrix multiplication is a pain on Android (OpenCV for Java/Android): Matrix
	   ops in general tbh. Python would be easier (hint hint, Python)
	 - Limited options for including hardware (IR or OF sensors could have been
	 	 extremely useful
	 - Library limitation OpenCV vs JavaCV ByteDeco
6. Code:
   - No coding style enforced
	 - A metric f*** tonne of unused code. Most of which isn't picked up as it
	   includes matrix initialisations as a usage.
		 - Literally, matrices declared, instantiated, maybe even copied into, and
		 	 then never used again.
	 - It's clear from some of the code that some progenetors did not understand
	   how some things worked (Mat reference is getting old but it's true).
	 - Poor documentation leads to fear of modifying existing code. Will it do exactly
	   what the old version did?
