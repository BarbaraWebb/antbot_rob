- Sensor research
- Sensor added
- Code refactored (dead code removed)
- Calibration code added to allow auto-detection of the camera mount with
  calibration method.
	Place the robot on the pitch, connected to a laptop via USB. Enable
	calibration on the robot by commenting the required line. Run any
	thread which uses the camera. Check the image displayed and the
	coordinates visible in logcat (filtered with CAL_FUN). Set coordinates.
	Disable calibration mode. There's probably no harm in leaving it on, but
	it gives more consistency in experiments and is faster to turn off.
